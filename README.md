#  Applied Data Science Lab at WorldQuant University

## Syllabus summary of the courses

In this repo, I summarized the syllabus of the hands-on courses in Data Science I took at WQU. These were compound by 8 end-to-end DS projects in which the common subjects were ETL pipelines, construction of supervised/unsupervised ML algorithms, as well as web app design, development and deployment.

N.b.: Due to the Copyright Licenses and Policies of WQU, none of the course notebooks are permitted to be published.
